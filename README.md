# Task-3--Basic-SELECT-Queries

DQL (Data Query Language) commands in SQL are used to retrieve and query data from a database. The primary and most commonly used DQL command is SELECT, which allows users to fetch data from one or more tables based on specific conditions.
DQL helps users analyze and view data without modifying it, making it essential for reporting and decision-making in database systems.
